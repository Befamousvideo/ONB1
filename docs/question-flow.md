## Flow Notes

- `PAIN_DISCOVERY` should focus on repetitive work, missed opportunities, bottlenecks, and lost revenue caused by inefficiencies.
- `AI_INFERENCE` is where the assistant uses business type plus interview answers to surface likely automation opportunities even when the user only names one pain point.
- `AI_INFERENCE` should classify the prospect by archetype first, then subtype, then apply the business-model questions before ranking the best automation to start with.
- `ROI_RECOMMENDATION` should rank the likely opportunities and explain which automation should be tackled first.
- If the prospect raises privacy, IP, or security concerns, the assistant should surface local/private AI options such as dedicated OpenClaw environments and DGX Spark-backed deployments.
- Scheduling should bias toward an in-person ROI audit for Orange County prospects when feasible; otherwise it should default to phone unless the user asks for something else.
- `SUBMIT` must produce an operator-ready handoff email to `vincent@storentech.com`.

## UX Notes
- **One question at a time** — chat bubble style, scrolling conversation
- **Quick reply chips** reduce typing friction
- **Progress indicator** shows step count + estimated time
- **"End & Send Now"** button always available as escape hatch
- **Mobile-first** — single column, large tap targets
- **Brand colors:** TBD (need StorenTech AI brand guidelines)
- **Tone:** Warm, professional, not robotic. Like talking to a helpful human.

## Existing Client Fields (for reference)
When `mode=client`:
- OTP email auth
- Project selection
- Request type: `Bug` · `Change` · `New Feature`
- Description, Impact, Urgency
- File attachments

## Next Iteration Guidance
- The AI should recognize business-type patterns such as plumber, field service, retail, manufacturing, and similar categories.
- The AI should use the 9-archetype recommendation structure before narrowing into subtype-specific logic.
- The AI should suggest 3 to 5 likely automation pain points, not just wait for the user to name one.
- The AI should rank likely pain points by ROI and recommend the first automation to solve.
- If the intake reveals multiple inefficiencies or unclear process losses, the assistant should push toward a detailed ROI audit rather than a generic intro call.
- The assistant should reference the business-type and offer guidance in `docs/chatbot-knowledge-base.md`.
